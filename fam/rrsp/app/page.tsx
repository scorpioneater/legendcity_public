<h2>Ancient Curses, Tayvis Kelsway, Who is the Most Gangsta in the NFL, and A Contest to Name Trevor Lawrence's Grunge Band</h2>
<br/>
<p>
 Well my fellow beer-guzzling, hot wing-inhaling, artery clogging sports bar flies - that's a wrap. The 2025 NFL regular season is over and you were probably dissapointed by how your team did, since the mighty are falling and the dynasties of the past are starting to look like waking giants (except for the Giants, ironically).
<br/>
<br/>
 The Curse of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce (Kelsway?) brought down a decade long AFC dynasty. The champion of Super Bowl I had a long drought, drafted Patrick Mahomes, and built a decade-lasting football powerhouse that routinely steamrolled its division opponents while also winning nearly every game that came down to the clutch. 
<br/>
<br/>
 OK, so maybe the complete locker room jock-lock that the Eagles admistered on them in Super Bowl LIX in front of a billion people exposed the weaknesses of the Andy Reed/Patrick Mahomes/Travis Kelce system. Or perhaps the league got more competitive, as other mobile-but-marksmanlike quarterbacks have found success in the league. Or it is just the law of averages - no empire lasts forever. 
<br/>
<br/>
  However:
  
  Given that the season ended with Mahomes being taken off the field in a stretcher, only to have some backup who looks like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdSwyg9-bnU">Steve Aoki come in and throw a </a> just as it looked like the second string could save the day, followed by a close loss to the LAS VEGAS RAIDERS, the only possible explanation for that run of bad luck and hilarious schadenfreude fodder can either be a demonic monkey paw, a malicious genie that Mahomes accidentally rubbed from a lap on a shopping trip to Morrocco, or the nuptuals and constant media attention and SEEMINGLY RANCH being a mega million dollar non-sequitor that did it (or at least contributed). I can only assume that the Swifts and the Kelces come from some long line of Appalachian mountain folk who have witches in the family and have cursed the meeting of these two clans. Email me if you have a better explanation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So let's get into the key matchups from week 18 and the stories that are taking us into this bizarro world of a 2025/Super Bowl LX playoff bracket:
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>1. DA BEARS!? The PAAAAAACCKEEERS!? Da Lions? Skol?</h3>
   <br/>
   I saw an image on instagram that personified the teams of the NFC North as so:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   - The Bears: That kid born in 1995 who won't shut up about the 80s,
   <br/>
   - The Lions: The ugly duckling or unpopular nerd who finally got popular enough to get a prom date and get a kiss or touch a boob, but has a long way to go to be Prom Royalty,
   <br/>
   - The PAAAAAACCKEEERS!: A bunch of redneck deer hunters who won't shut up about the 90s and FAV RE, and who believe that Reggie White was like the John Brown of Packers rings since he preached and prayed to God for it every day
   <br/>
   - The Vikings: The Beauty Pageant Contestant/Politician/Competitive Runner who is always at least the 3rd runner up despite being just as good as the winner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Say what you will about football up in the frozen north of Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan: the combination of smashmouth, run and gun, and the fact that you need 3 pairs of long johns to play on a good day when there is 10 degree wind chill, nevermind when it is snowing on the tundra, has probably contributed to this division having 4 teams with over .500 records. Only one, the Vikings - Skol? - aren't invited to feast on the meed, the tavern wenches, the valkyries, and other awesome Nordic stuff in the Valhalla/Ragnarok known as the NFL's big dance.
    <br/>
   <br/>
   Now, I lived in Chicago for 3 years before moving back to the Valley of the Sun at the start of 2025. I made it a rule to bet the moneyline against the Cardinals and the Bears in all situations because the bears SUCKED while I was there. They were basements dwellers who are in danger of being shipped away from Soldier Field to some shitty suburb called Arlington (that is in Chicagoland, but it is not Chicago). From the ditch that their coaching stuff dug them into, they had to watch the Lions win 1 fewer games than they lost back in their famous record-holding goose-egg, 100% defeated, .000 percentage 0-16 year. Let that sink in for a second. And the Vikings were the only team that beat the Lions, and lost only one other game. And the PAAAAAACCKEEERS are in an eternal beer and meth fueled drama to give a little coastal village in Wisconsin the illusion of being the greatest football team of all time, so their shareholders (the Packers Fans) will riot if they don't make the playoffs. Or if they win the Super Bowl. Have I mentioned that they like football, the Packers, and riots?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But WTF? The Bears won the divison. They did siphon off the Lions' offensive coordinator, but some other magic must have happened, besides the strong play of Caleb Williams. Should they just go ahead and record a rap song now? Get A-List Chicago gangsta rap producers to record it - The Super Bowl LX Scuffle, by Da' Bears 2025. It's been 40 years since Jim McMahon, Sweetness, the Fridge, and all those big talented mofos steamrolled the league and whooped the Patriots like the English at The Battle of Brandywine. Or like the Eagles whooped the Chiefs in 2024. Why not?

   </div>
    <br/>
   <br/> 
   But now on to the real gangstas, the DETROIT LIONS.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Don't believe me? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8Kn3H9kOqA">The jaw pop from the Lions meeting with the Chiefs was pure Detroit street style.</a>
    <br/>
   <br/>
   So the Lions experienced Conference regular season champion, first round bye jitters and lost in a shootout to a good Wahsington team. There was speculation if they could be an elite team again despite losing key memebers of the coaching staff. And watching the Lions play over the course of the season, especially that last minute quasi-spoiler field goal with time running out, sending a message to Da Bears, "you may be the future of the division, but we are still here and we are punching it straight through your FING face/uprights to make that point." They ran with machine efficiency - they are the Robocop of NFL offenses. However, any defensive strategy that breaks up their effieciency tends to cause them to rely on their tough and competent but ultimately vulnerable defense. Expect them to rebuild and challenge for the Division and Conference titles next season.
    <br/>
   <br/>
   On to the Vikings, the Mighty Norsemen, who were probably cursed by leprechauns or druids or something when they raided Ireland, and the curse was passed by some 4th generation Scandanavian imigrant to the Twin Cities. This is worse than the Tayvis Kelsway curse: it goes back to the old country. How is it possible for a franchise this good to miss the playoffs and, if they get there, go nowhere? The answer is leprechauns.
    <br/>
   <br/>
   I only have three things to say about the Packers - they are the worst team in the NFC Playoff race that is not a division winner, they have won me money all year because the oddsmakers give them ridiculous spreads, and go PAAAAAAAAAACCCKEEERRRS!! ...
    <br/>
   <br/>
   ... and close the door to your dilapidated trailer on the way out.

<h3>2. The Bird Men May Repeat and Start a Super Bowl Dynasty with The Ass Blaster (My Name for the Tush Push)</h3>
<br/>

   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUHhB1C-5ZY">Prepare for the Ass Blaster</a>
   OK, on to this and last season's greatest controversey and running joke; the Eagle's signature play, which:
    <br/>
   <br/>
   1. The league wants to ban
   <br/>
   2. Coaches want to ban
   <br/>
   3. Bad teams with poor defensive lines want to ban
   <br/>
   4. The Fundamentalist Right wants to ban
   <br/>
   5. Fans just think it's funny, and it works
   <br/>
   6. People new to football are like "what's a Tush Push?"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   So let me explain, as I had to last Sunday to a group of people when I knew that Carolina was going to use it on 4th and inches:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   - The offense lines up in what looks like a quarterback sneak or other short yardage, 4th down go to play
   <br/>
   - Rather than performing a sneak, play action, or other options in this formation, the quarterback holds on to the ball and a RB/FB PUSHES HIM  BY THE ASS SO THAT HE SQUEEZES THROUGH THE DEFENSE.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   So "Tush Push" is the G-rated, family-fiendly network TV term. I think it is more accurate to call it the "Ass Blaster." A 230+ man who can squat 800 lbs applies pressure to the backside of the ball carrier, and does not stop until that carrier has been forced past 1500 lbs of linemen and linebackers. Is it ethical? Is it cheating? Does anyone really care about the homoerotic factor, since this is football we are talking about and the "butt slap" tradition has been around since at least the 70s?
<br/>
   <br/>
   I don't know. But the Eagles may repeat entirely on the strength of their ass blasting. Go Philly!   

   <br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<h3>3. Does Anyone in Las Vegas Care About the Raider's Record?</h3>
 <br/>
   So the Raiders could have had the number one pick, but they decided to pick on the poor shambling zombie corpse of the Chiefs and win by a bizarre score that looks like the outcome of indoor roller hockey. I've felt sorry for Geno Smith and his mighty cornrows all year because it is obvoius that he is a good playmaking QB with absolutely no one to throw to or hand the ball to who can gain yardage. 
 <br/>
   <br/>
   However, are the Raiders really in Vegas to win games? I doubt it: the city of Las Vegas isn't in a cash crunch, to say the least. I believe the real reason they are in Sin City on the Meadows is because the league needed to contain Raider Nation. Only in Vegas can you have a large detention cell and medical staff on site when the fans of this storied franchise identifing entirely with the grinning dagger-clenching pirate in the logo and live their lives according to what he would do. Sort of like WWJD but with more black clothes, shoulder pads that would make Gwar say "man, these guys are too theatrical," and LOTS OF STABBINGS.
 <br/>
   <br/>
   Since the NFL is doing international games in countries with police-monitered soccer hooligan groups, can we organize a sparring event between Raider Nation and the drunkest, scariest Manchester United thugs that the UK can send at us? I would take that as a halftime shown any day.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<h3>4. The Rise of Jacksonville Grunge?</h3>
<br/>
   <br/>
   As I wrote during the week in which it appeared that the Chiefs would win out the season and go on to business as usual of defending their dynasty, the scrappy Jacksonville Jaguars, at the time a team with 5 wins and a +14 turnover differential, scored on a last minute broken play where the Last Grunge Guy, Trevor Lawrence, tripped over his own center's cleets and still ran a Mahomes-like TD into the endzone. These guys are a team of destiny, and I am choosing them as my AFC spoiler. They won the division convincingly and always seem to play ballsy, smashmouth football on both sides of the game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But on to the important question: what should Trevor Lawrence's 90s grunge band be called? Here are some ideas:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   - Mookie Blaylock (The original name of Pearl Jam and a sports reference, though the wrong sport)
   <br/>
   - The Fan Boaters (Has a bit too much of an indie rock vibe)
   <br/>
   - Swamphoney (I think this is the winner so far)
      <br/>
   <br/>
   Email me with more suggestions but I'm going with Swamphoney for now. If you can work in a clever alligator reference you are the winner.
    <br/>
   <br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<h3>5. The Cowboys Still Suck</h3>
 <br/>
 <br/>
   Let me reference one more social media image: 
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dallas Cowboys: "At least we're still America's Team."
   <br/>
   Houston Texans:  "Bitch, you're not even Texas' Team anymore."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I saw this joke a decade ago and it still holds true, no matter how much money Dak Prescott has made for me with his 2+ passing TD, 275+ yard games. I lived in Austin,TX for acouple of months and saw a sports radio staion billboard that said to follow yuour favortitre Texas sports teams. This did not include the Cowboys. Expect the Texans to beat or at least keep it close with the Steelers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking of ...
   <br/>
   <br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<h3>6. Two Multi-Ring Super Bowl Titans Make Peewee Football Mistakes After the 2 Minute Warning in Battle for 2nd Crappiest Division Champion</h3>
<br/>
   <br/>
   So on to week 18 Sunday Night Football - The Steelers vs. The  Ravens. The battle for the AFC North crown, and a virtual playoff game. So with 7 Super Bowl Trophies between these teams, the Raven's winning streak that lifted them out of their early injusies, and Lamar Jackson/Aaron Rogers as the helmsmen, this was expected to be a great game.
<br/>
   <br/>
   And it was epic, except for one thing:
<br/>
   <br/>
   After the 2 minute warning these teams forgot how to play football. Maybe terrorists shot them with a secret mind ray that made them think they were playing badminton.
<br/>
   <br/>
   So the insane sequence of events in which the Steelers scored a go-ahead TD but MISSED the extra point, and then the Ravens had the game, with position for a chip shot field goal, and they MISSED WIDE RIGHT!
<br/>
   <br/>
   OK, so the offenses played well in the clutch. But a football team is one unit - as my line coach used to scream "when one of you is offside, all of you are offside." A much harsher, manlier way of repeating the old cliche "THERE IS NO 'I' IN TEAM!"
<br/>
   <br/>
   There is no excuse for these kinds of peewee football blunders at the highest level of the game. I think it is a sign that these were overachieving teams and the Steelers, no matter how much I root for them as they were my dad's team, aren't likely to escape the wildcard round.  
<br/>
   
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<h3>7. THE BATTLE OF OHIO!! (zzzzzzzzzzz ... and Other Week 18 Suck Bowls)</h3>
<br/>
   The Browns vs. The Bengals! The team with a defense that can shut down almost anyone and ... that's about it vs. the team that has traded for Joe FING Flacco but could only put points on the board when it came time to embarssing Aaron Rogers and the Steelers in the Geriatric Bowl. 
   <br/><br/>
   I don't have the patience to search through the annals of NFL lore to find when both Ohio teams were playoff contenders at the same time. It is usually one or the other, and the Bengals had a decent AFC Championship and respectable loss to a much tighter Rams team. The Browns not only have the most boring name in professional sports ("Fear us: we are named after a neutral color, the color of poo."), they have been involved in 80% of the most boring games this season, even when they were upsetting the PAAAAAAAAAACCCKEEERRRS! 
   <br/><br/>
   So what does near perfect mediocrity look like in a single NFL game? The winning team outscored the losing team 7-6 in the first and second quarters. The Bengals scored nothing but touchdowns but had a blocked PAT (go Browns defense/special teams!), and somehow the completely offense-less Browns kept up with them to be up 14-12 at the half. And then the little engine that can eek out 2 TDs ran out of gas and kept hitting field goals until it had won the Moses Cleveland Trophy that goes to the winner of the Ohio Bowl. OK, I made that up, but it would make for a better story than a crappy team beating another crappy team by 2 points with a last second field goal. Moses Cleveland invented Cleveland Yeah!
   <br/><br/>
   (For more Ohio suckitude, reference Electric Six's "Escape from Ohio.")
   <br/><br/>
   So let's do some one-liner recaps of the other Suck Bowls. Most were not this epic in suckitude:
   <br/><br/>
   - Saints vs. Falcons: the South is NOT going to rise again. Laisse les mal temps rollez ...
   <br/>
   - Cowboys vs. Giants: HAHA! (see "The Cowboys Still Suck" above for more details.)
   <br/>
   - Chiefs vs. Raiders: In the late 60s/early 70s this would have been a clash of AFC titans.
                         Now it is a sad reminder that the Chiefs now suck, and that is kind of depressing because it means we are all vulnerable to becoming Navin from The Jerk. And The Raiders know that they suck, and are probably throwing games to get huge payouts from mob bosses or Southeast Asian whales. Did I mention that Raider Nation is basically a criminal gang and the Juggalos aren't, even though the FBI treats them that way?  
   <br/>
   - Panthers vs. Buccaneers: The only "Suck Bowl" that produced a division-winning playoff team. Neither team is really bad, but the Bucs overachieved early and their one-dimensional reliance on Steve Spurrier-like fun and gun passing caused their division champ run to fizzle out. The Panthers, meanwhile, had to come from behind only to lose a close game to THE CARDINALS. That seemed to be a wakeup call for them and they played their hearts out to be big fish in a small pond. 
   <br/><br/>
   We really have to reform this playoff horse hockey again. An 8-9 team, no matter how capable and scrappy, should not get an invite to the dance when the Lions and other teams with WINNNING records have to sit out another postseason. <br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<h3>8. The NFC West Menage a Trois/Cardinals Gangbang</h3>
<br/>
    So something odd happened in the NFC West this year - 3 11+ win playoff teams and at least 2 real Super Bowl contenders. However, something is missing from the math of the standings:
	<br/>
	<br/>
	You see, each of these teams gets 2 free wins against the Cardinals, when the Cardinals decide to forget they were once a Super Bowl contender and continue to Cardinal. Cardinals gonna Cardinal, and the Seahawks, Rams, and 49ers gonna get a boost. So here are their records as adjusted for Cardinals suckitude:
<br/>
<br/>
    Seahawks - 12-5
	<br/>
    Rams     - 10-7
	<br/>
    49ers    - 9-8	
	<br/>
	<br/>
	OK, so the 49ers won 1 more game than this, but they needed a last second field goal to beat the Cardinals. Plus they aren't really that good.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	As you can see, they are still playoff teams, with the Seahawks probably having the best shot at upending the Bird Men for the NFC crown. The Rams are also dangerous, and can easily make the conference championship. The 49ers may pull off an upset as they have been surprising teams all year in the face of injuries and a tough schedule (minus the Cards). But I expect them to bow out before or at the dividional round.
	<br/>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<h3> 9. The Cardinals Are the Abyss Nietzsche Warned Us About</h3>
<br/>
	<br/>
    "He who fights monsters must be careful not to become a monster,
    And when you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares into you."
	 <br/>
	<br/>
	<img src="./FreddieN.jpg" alt="Fred"/>
	        -------------------------------- The Polish/German Dude With the Huge Mustache Who Predicted Everything
	<br/>
	<br/>					 
	Well, I'm not sure what Freddie's definition of an abyss is, but 30+ years of being a Cardinals fan seriously does wear at your soul to the point where you feel you have been dragged into an eternal, inescapable darkness. Your cynicism to how bad your team can be turns so great that it leads to numbness and a deadening of the soul.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	"Oh, they are getting shelled by Matt Stafford and the Rams and he has like 4 TD passes. Oh well, at least I expected it."
	<br/>
	<br/>
	No matter how bad your team is, no matter how much they dissapoint you, no matter how much you feel your season tickets or your NFL Network package is a waste of money, only the Cardinals will drag you into the abyss, it's dark, steely gaze pulling you into the eerie void of untermensch football badness. 
	<br/>
	</p>
	<p>
	<br/>
	<h3> 10. Postscript: The Cardinals Suck Harder Than the Black Hole At the Center of the Milky Way</h3>
	<br/>
	<br/>
            Worst team ever.
    <br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	        - GMP out.
	<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I found the one light of hope the Cardinals had besides their heartbreaking Super Bowl loss to the Steelers: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lvPTUCeoMI"> the time they made the playoffs for the first time in 60 years and destroyed one of the most elite Cowboys teams in NFL History on their home field in Texas.</a> This was their version of the Super Bowl. I have seen the light and been lifted out of the abyss ...
